dm-maker

DataMapper extension to generate instances from YAML


API
===

`DataMapper::Maker.make(src)`, where `src` is either an object or a YAML string

when using references (see below), order of occurrence matters; instances must
be defined before they can be referenced

if any errors occur, the respective instance is stored in an "_errors" member
of the returned hash (unless `raise_on_save_failure` is used)


Examples
========

(extracted from tests, which provide a more comprehensive overview)

    Person:
    -
      name: John Doe
      age: 11
    -
      name: Jane Doe
      age: 13

associations:

    Person:
      name: John
      cars:
      -
        name: Herbie
        manufacturer:
          name: VW
      -
        name: KITT
        manufacturer:
          name: Knight Industries

(note that associated instances may include a `$class` attribute, which might be
required due to Single Table Inheritance)

ERB expansion:

    Person:
    <% 2.times do |i| %>
    -
      name: Johnny <%= i + 5 %>
      age: <%= i %>
    <% end %>

references:

    Family:
    -
      $id: f1
      name: Doe

    Person:
    -
      name: John
      family: { $ref: f1 }
    -
      name: Jane
      family: { $ref: f1 }
